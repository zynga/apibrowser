API Browser
============================

The API Browser uses data generated by Jasy to render documentation for JavaScript projects.


## Usage

The API Browser requires to use the [Jasy](http://github.com/zynga/jasy) tooling framework as the data it parses is based on the output of that tool. As soon as you have configured Jasy for your project just add another task to your `jasyscript.py`:

```python
@task
def api():

    # Writes API data to api/data
    ApiWriter().write("data")

    # Generates API browser into api folder
    runTask("apibrowser", "build")

```



## Roadmap

### 2012

* Add support for search by keyword (method, event, property)
* Add list for tags / tag links (show other classes with same tag)


## Authors

The API Viewer is an official Zynga OpenSource project.
